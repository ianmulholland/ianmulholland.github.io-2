									<h3>Professional Experience <i class="fa fa-building" aria-hidden="true"></i></h3>
									<ul>
										<h4>MIT Solve</h4>
										<em>Results Measurement Officer</em>
										<br><em>2018-2021</em></br>
										<li>Led the product development of Solve’s proprietary platform and selection process of 4,000+ applications annually. Product improvements grew submissions by 97% from 2019-2020.</li>
										<li>Developed Solve's proprietary normalized scoring methodology used to select high growth entrepreneurs - this methodology has been adopted by organizations such as the World Bank, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and IDB.</li>
										<li>Designed and built Solve's impact measurement program. I wrote and deployed surveys, led deep analysis into Solve's databases using PowerBI, Tableau, and Excel to explain Solve's impact and identify areas of continued growth. Today, Solve's teams have reached 120 million lives and facilitated $50+ million in resources for social impact entrepreneurs in low resourced areas. </li>
										<li>Served as the primary technology and data administrator, building Solve's Salesforce database, Hubspot tool,  event management platforms, and for building reports and visualizations used for MIT and Solve Leadership, marketing, and finance teams. I was also responsible for the onboarding and training of Solve's staff to new technology.</li>
										<p></p>

										<h4>Self-Employed Women's Association</h4>
										<em>Livelihood & Digital Initiatives Lead</em>
										<br><em>2016-2018</em></br>
										<br> I helped women-led small businesses  grow through marketing, sales, and management support. I worked with small farmers in Uttarakhand through a women-run organic spice cooperative, called Ekta, I work with a home-based artisans producers' company in Delhi, Ruaab, that produces high-end designer fashion items, and have helped handloom weavers in West Bengal reach markets across India. 

										I also helped the organization build and manage digital solutions that support communities across India. I worked towards creating systems that created visibility into India's remotest communities, solutions that propeled and promoted growth and expansion, and tools that are useful for people across linguistic, regional, and social spectrums.</br>
										<br>A few of the projects I led: </br>
										<li> A system that ensures the delivery and measures the effectiveness of public/social security programs in low-income communities across India</li>
										<li>A payment and delivery solution for a solar-energy cooperative working in rural and off-grid communities in Bihar</li>
										<li>An internal platform to manage, track, and grow fundraising efforts</li>
										<p></p>
										
										<h4>Self-Employed Women's Association</h4>
										<em>Livelihood & Digital Initiatives Lead</em>
										<br><em>2015-2016</em></br>
										<br>SEWA solves India's largest problems through a mix of institutional development, grassroots advocacy, development programs, and community investment. SEWA is a women-led, community focused movement that has redefined and shaped the economic and social development landscape of today, by pathfinding approaches through microfinance, cooperative, and leadership development.

										My role at SEWA was two fold. One one hand, I led the strategic communication efforts of the organization in order to move SEWA's mission forward. I communicated to a diverse audience of underserved communities throughout India, international funders  private organizations, and public agencies. Additionally, I cultivatee and deepened relationships with strategic partners and allies. SEWA has had a history of cutting edge approaches to economic and social development and I help defined that strategic direction  to digital access gaps, climate change, and sustainable and fair working conditions.</br>
										<p></p>
										
										<h4>Mobee (now Wiser)</h4>
										<em>Business Development</em>
										<br><em>2014-2015</em></br>
										<br>At Mobee, I was the first Business Development hire. For my role in Business Development, I touched all aspects of the business. I served as the administrator for Salesforce, DiscoverOrg, Salesloft, and InsightSquared, contributed to the structure and strategy development of the sales and marketing teams, built and managed the inside sales team, and served in a sales support role for the account executives. During my time at Mobee, the team grew by 28% and had $1.5+ million in sales.</br>

									<h4>What guides me <i class="fa fa-compass" aria-hidden="true"></i></h4>
									<br> Before starting into my technical skills, I'd like to take a moment to highlight what is important to me as a teammate.</br>	
									<li><b>Mental Health & Humor:</b> Mental Health has become a buzzword up there with synergy that has lost a lot of the meaning of the word. I love teams that genuinely value the mental health and manage the burnout of teammates. I value teams that can laugh and not take life too seriously. </li>
									<li><b>Collaboration & Experimentation:</b> I love working on teams that value initiative to start and pursue projects that move the ball forward. I believe that learning through taking risks is what makes a job worth doing!</li>
									<li><b>Teaching & Learning:</b> It is important that other members on my team feel empowered to learn new skills and understand different roles. I built training sessions for community workers in Delhi to learn Excel for impact analysis and case management; trained MIT Solve's intern classes on Salesforce; and led  MIT Solve's training programs on new technologies introduced to the organization.</li>
										<br></br>

										<h5>Python <i class="fa fa-code" aria-hidden="true"></i></h5>
										<em>Intermediate</em>
										<br> Examples of Projects</br>
										<ul>
											<li>Currently leading a text modeling project, leveraging TF-IDF and sentiment analysis. The goal of this project is to understand how to support high impact organizations across the globe in fundraising applications. </li>
											<li>Currently leading a project to understand how MIT Solve's programmatic support help the impact growth of social impact organizations across the globe. This project leverages several regression models to see how MIT Solve's support ultimately lead to catalytic change in communities across the globe.</li>
											<li>Most of my other current projects include projects for school and are more academic than practical. Two of my favorites: a model of the solar system using DrawSVG and an interactive Josephus Problem</li>
										</ul>
										<h5>SQL <i class="fa fa-code" aria-hidden="true"></i></h5>
										<em>Intermediate</em>
										<br> Examples of Projects</br>
										<ul>
										<li>I used SQL queries to extract insights from Mobee’s secret shopper mobile application. The insights were used to produce data visualizations for Fortune 500 companies to adjust and measure the success of in-store marketing campaigns.</li>
										</ul>
										<h5>Apex <i class="fa fa-code" aria-hidden="true"></i></h5>
										<em>Intermediate</em>

										<h5>Salesforce <i class="fa fa-cloud" aria-hidden="true"></i></h5>
										<em>Expert</em>

										<br>I was the primary adminstrator for two Salesforce environments: one at MIT and a mobile technology startup, called Mobee. In both experiences, I was the product manager, scoping new features and developments; architect, building new features; and QA, where I tested and fixed bugs within the environments.</br>
										<ul>
										<li>I am most proud of learning how to scope and build tools for diverse organizational needs. I transformed a Salesforce environment into an impact measurement tool that stored, measured, and visualized the growth of MIT Solve's impact.</li>
										<li>I scoped, built, and maintained a Salesforce environment for MIT Solve that collected and ran the organization impact measurement; grew fundraising efforts; and served as an event management tool.</li>
										<li>I created a traditional CRM for a mobile technology startup, Mobee, that was used to manage relationships with customers and prospects.</li>
										</ul>
										<h5>Hubspot <i class="fa fa-sitemap" aria-hidden="true"></i></h5>
										<em>Intermediate</em>
										<br> At MIT Solve, I transformed the organization's Hubspot environment from an outbound marketing email tool into a fully-automated inbound marketing machine used to grow applications to the organization's yearly challenges and increase its fundraising efforts.</br>
